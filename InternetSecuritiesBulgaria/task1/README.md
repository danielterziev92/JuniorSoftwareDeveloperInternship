### As an aspiring Python developer, I successfully completed a task to extract dates from a given text. Leveraging regular expressions, I created a script to identify and capture dates in various formats within the text. The task involved handling date formats such as "YYYY-MM-DD," "YYYY/MM/DD," month names, and ordinal numbers.

### Key Achievements:

* Implemented a Python script to extract dates from a diverse text sample.
* Utilized regular expressions to accommodate different date formats and variations.
* Successfully captured dates expressed in digits, month names, and ordinal numbers.
* Ensured flexibility in handling dates with and without specific times.

### Technologies and Tools Used:

* Python
* Regular Expressions
